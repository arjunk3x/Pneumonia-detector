# Pneumonia-detector
CNNs scan X-rays like detectives, learning lung patterns. They extract key features, like edges and textures, that could signal pneumonia. By stacking these insights, CNNs learn to identify the hallmarks of this lung infection.
Project Title: Pneumonia Detection Using CNNs

Overview:
This project aims to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images through the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) system. CNNs have proven to be effective in image classification tasks, making them suitable for medical image analysis. The project focuses on preprocessing the image data, building a CNN model, training it on labeled datasets, and evaluating its performance.
